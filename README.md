# OpenDTV

**An open source Android ISDB-T player application built for ISDB-T compliant TV dongle tuners.**

OpenDTV lets you watch free-to-air digital TV on your Android phone, tablet, or TV box by plugging in a USB ISDB-T dongle. It talks to the tuner directly over USB host (OTG), so no vendor app is needed. It also includes a transport stream analyzer, EPG, closed captions, a full ARIB data broadcast (BML) viewer, and a multi-country EWBS emergency alert system.

## Compatible Hardware

| Device | USB ID | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Mygica PadTV PT275 | `048d:275a` | Supported (confirmed on hardware) |
| GMA Now Dongle | `048d:275a` | Supported |
| IT9175 Tuner (ITE/Afatech) | `048d:275a` | Supported |
| ABS-CBN TV Plus GO (Tolka, IT9308) | `048d:9308` | Supported, **needs testing** |

> The PT275, GMA Now and IT9175 dongles share the same chip family and driver. The ABS-CBN TV Plus GO (IT9308) uses its own driver path and has not been widely tested yet, so please report your results (see [Contributing](#contributing)). More ISDB-T dongles may be added over time.

Your Android device must support **USB Host (OTG)**.

## Features

### Viewing
- Live ISDB-T TV playback (ExoPlayer / Media3) with fast channel start
- Hardware decoding via MediaCodec, with an **FFmpeg software fallback** for formats your device cannot decode
- Channel list with **virtual channel numbers**, station logos, and **favorites**
- **Auto Scan** (quick list or full UHF sweep, 473.143 to 695.143 MHz) and **Manual Scan** (MHz, kHz, or UHF channel number)
- **Electronic Program Guide (EPG)** from broadcast EIT data
- **Audio track and language selection**. When no language is chosen, the best track is picked automatically (AAC is preferred over MP2)
- **Closed captions** (ARIB), as a simple text line or styled, broadcast-layout captions
- **Channel recording** to a transport stream file
- Portrait and landscape layouts for phones and tablets, plus a TV layout

### EWBS (Emergency Warning Broadcast System)
OpenDTV detects emergency signalling in the broadcast and warns you on screen and with an alarm tone.

- **Detection sources:** the emergency start-up flag (TMCC / IIP), the PMT emergency information descriptor (`0xFC`), and BML event messages
- **Multi-country profiles** in **Settings > EWBS**:

| Country | Code | Area codes | Default language |
|---|---|---|---|
| Philippines | `PHL` (`50 48 4C`) | 17 regions (PSGC) | Tagalog |
| Brazil | `BRA` (`42 52 41`) | 27 states (IBGE) | Português |
| Peru | `PER` (`50 45 52`) | 25 departments (UBIGEO) | Español |
| Japan | `JPN` (`4A 50 4E`) | 47 prefectures (JIS X 0401) | 日本語 |

- **Location / Area code:** choose your area from a *code - area* list, pick *All areas / nationwide*, or enter a custom 12-bit hex code. Alerts for other areas are shown differently and do not sound the alarm.
- **Message languages:** English, Tagalog, Português, 日本語, Español (Auto uses the country's language)
- **Event types:** earthquake, tsunami, typhoon / severe weather, flood, volcanic eruption, and test / maintenance
- **Signal level:** level 1 = emergency / mandatory alert, level 0 = test / non-urgent
- **On-screen banner** with event type, level, affected areas, and a short safety instruction:
  - Red = emergency for your area
  - Blue = test signal (drills)
  - Amber = alert for another area, or "EWBS was signalled" after it ends (so finished recordings still show it)
- **Emergency tone:** alternating 640 Hz / 1024 Hz alarm. Loops during a real alert, one quiet pass for tests. Tap the banner to mute the current alert, or turn the tone off in Settings > EWBS. The tone never changes your system volume.
- **Analyzer EWBS tab** with the decoded report and a timestamped event log

> EWBS area matching uses each country's national 2-digit code. If your broadcaster uses a different numbering, use **Custom code** in Location / Area. The event type is read from the reserved bits after `signal_level` in the `0xFC` descriptor, so reports from real broadcasts are very welcome.

### Data Broadcast (BML)
- Full ARIB data broadcast display over the video, with built-in BML sounds and fonts
- On-screen remote panel in portrait; D-pad, number, and colour-key support in landscape
- Keyboard and TV remote control support (see [Controls](#controls))

### Android TV / TV Boxes
- Registers an **OpenDTV ISDB-T TV input** for the system *Live Channels* app (Android 9+ / API 28+)
- Channel scan writes channels and EPG data to the TV provider

### Analyzer and Developer Tools
- Signal strength and quality bars with dBm readout
- Transport stream analyzer: PAT / PMT / SDT / NIT / EIT / TDT-TOT, PID statistics, CC / TEI / sync-loss counters
- DSM-CC data carousel inspector
- Open a `.ts` capture file to test and develop without a dongle
- USB probe diagnostic screen

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer
- A device with USB Host (OTG) support and an OTG cable or adapter
- A compatible ISDB-T dongle (see above)
- An ISDB-T antenna and signal coverage in your area
- Recommended: a recent Android System WebView (for BML and styled captions)

### Installation
1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Plug the dongle into your device with an OTG adapter.
3. Open OpenDTV and allow the USB permission prompt.
4. Open the menu and choose **Auto Scan** to find channels.
5. Pick a channel and start watching.
6. Go to **Settings > EWBS** and set your country and area so alerts are matched to your location.

### Using with Live Channels (Android TV / TV box)
1. Install the APK, plug in the dongle, and allow USB permission.
2. Open **Live Channels > Settings > Channel sources** (or the *OpenDTV channel scan* icon on the launcher).
3. Choose **OpenDTV ISDB-T** and run a **Quick scan** or **Full scan**.
4. Watch from Live Channels.

Notes: one tuner means one viewing session at a time. EPG times are based on the offset between the broadcast clock and your device clock, so make sure your device date and time are correct.

## Building from Source

Open the project in Android Studio and let Gradle sync, then run on a device with USB host support.

The pure Java transport stream and EWBS logic can be tested without Android:

```
javac -encoding UTF-8 -d out <pure-java files in app/src/main/java/ph/opendtv/ts> tools/EwbsSelfTest.java
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp out EwbsSelfTest
```

See `tools/TsSelfTest.java` for the transport stream parser test.

## Known Limitations

- **No descrambling.** No B-CAS code is included or planned, so encrypted services will not play.
- Virtual channel numbers come from the NIT `remote_control_key_id`. This is a heuristic and may need adjusting for the local channel plan.
- Broadcast times are shown as received. ARIB specifies JST (UTC+9), but local broadcasters may differ.
- MPEG-2 playback with hardware decoding depends on your device having an MPEG-2 decoder. Otherwise the FFmpeg fallback is used.
- Not ported from the vendor library: ALPU authentication, crystal indexes other than 0/1, and EEPROM-configured variants.
- Tuner support has been confirmed on a real PT275. The IT9308 and other listed dongles may behave differently.
- EWBS area lists are region / state / department / prefecture level only (no province or city level), and the alert tone is an audible alarm, not a decoded FSK signal. The device does not auto-wake from standby.
